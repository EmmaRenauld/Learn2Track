normalize_directions:
If true, directions will be normalized. If the step size is
                 fixed, it shouldn't make any difference. If streamlines are
                 compressed, in theory you should normalize, but you could
                 hope that not normalizing could give back to the algorithm a
                 sense of distance between points."
